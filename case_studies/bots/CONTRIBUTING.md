# Contributing Guide

## Issue contributions

For either questions or bugs, submit a new issue in our GitHub repostiory.
First, **ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub
under [Issues][issues]. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing
the problem or answering the question [open a new one][open-issue].

Describe the issue including all the necessary steps to reproduce it when
reporting a bug. Be sure to include a **title and clear description** and
as much relevant information as possible. When reporting a bug it is very
useful to include an **example code** demonstrating the expected behavior
that is not occurring.

## Code contributions

If you want to contribute in this repository you will need to follow these
steps:
1. Fork this project in your personal GitHub space.
2. Make your changes in this repository. Try to:
   * Follow our [coding guidelines][coding].
   * Branch from the master branch and, if needed, rebase to the current master
     branch before submitting your pull request (step 3). If it doesn't merge
     cleanly with master you may be asked to rebase your changes.
   * Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit
     is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass
     tests). Write [good commit messages][commit].
   * Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature which allow to verify
     your changes (if needed).
3. Obtain, fill and sign the [contribution agreement document][contribute].
   Then fax a signed copy to (+34) 93 413 77 21 or email a scanned copy of a
   signed agreement to pm-contributions[^1]
4. Make a pull request. If your patch is not getting reviewed you can ask for
   it by sending an email to pm-tools[^1].
