(** [bind_args fresh_names tg]: expects the target [tg] to point at a function call.
      Then it takes [fresh_names] which is a list of strings where the string
      at index i represents the variable going to be binded to the argument i
      of the function call. If one doesn't want to bind the argument at index i
      then it just leaves it as an empty string "". Basically this transformation is
      just an aplication of bind_intro n times. Where n is the numer of strings inside
      [fresh_names] different from "".
      If [inline_impure_mark] is set, forces every impure argument to be bound before
      but add the [inline_impure_mark] to those that should be inlined later because they
      were given no name. *)

(** [inline ?resname ?vars ?args ?delete ?recurse ?simpl tg]: expects the target [tg] to point at a function call
    Then it will try to inline that function call. If it's possible this transformation tries to
    perform as many simplifications as possible.

    - [vars]: renaming scheme for local variables that occur in the body of the inlined function
    - [args]: names for binding the function arguments before the call, any empty string corresponds to an argument that should not be bound outside and inlined instead (by default we consider that each argument should be inlined inside).
    - [delete]: if true, the function definition should be removed as well
    - [recurse]: inlines functions recursively within the inlined bodies
    - [simpl]: simplifications to perform around subtituted arguments (by default [Variable.default_inline_simpl]).
