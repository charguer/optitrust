    Prior to translating the input sequential program into task candidate graphs

    {1:function_call_extraction Function call extraction}

    Function calls represent our main parallelization target. The goal of this
    transformation pass is to make their identification as task candidates
    easier. Indeed, we may find function calls within variable declaration
    statements which we do not consider as suitable task candidates. One of the
    goals of this pass is to detach the initialization, provided it is a
    function call, from the variable declaration and replace the original
    statement by two new statements, i.e. a variable declaration and a value
    assignment. If the initial declaration qualifies the variable as [const],
    this property must be removed. Moreover, a single statement may feature a
    nested call involving multiple functions. This situation prevents us from
    considering each of the function calls as an individual task candidate. The
    pass thus unfolds nested function calls while assigning the intermediate
    return values into temporary variables. *)

(** [extract_function_calls tg]: expects target [tg] to point at a function
    body. It moves all function calls under target [tg] out of variable
    declarations and nested function calls.

    For example

    {[
    int a = f(g(2));
    ]}
    
    becomes

    {[
    int __apac_var1;
    __apac_var1 = g(2);
    int __apac_var2;
    __apac_var2 = f(__apac_var1);
    int a = __apac_var2;
    ]}
    
    However

    {[
    int a;
    a = f(g(2));
    ]}
    
    becomes

    {[
    int a;
    int __apac_var1;
    __apac_var1 = g(2);
    a = f(__apac_var1);
    ]}
    
    as the call to [f] is already apart from the declaration of [a].

    Also note that

    {[
    const int * a = foo();
    ]}
    
    becomes
    
    {[
    int * a;
    a = foo();
    ]}

    as we must remove the [const] property. *)
let extract_function_calls (tg : target) : unit =
  Target.iter (fun t p ->
    (** Get the parent term to check whether it is an assignment (outside of a

(** {1:constification Constification}

    The presence of the [const] qualifier in a function prototype helps us to
    determine whether the function modifies a given argument by side-effect,
    i.e. through a pointer or a reference, and classify the argument as
    read-write or read-only during the data dependency discovery (see
    [!Apac_taskify.trm_discover_dependencies] and [!Apac_taskify.taskify_on]).
    In C++ specifically, functions representing class member methods may carry
    the [const] qualifier too. In this case, it indicates that the method does
    not modify any of the class member variables.

    However, the programmers do not always make use of the [const] qualifier
    which makes the data dependency discovery in function calls harder. The goal
    of the constification is to add the [const] qualifier to arguments in
    function prototypes wherever it is possible and useful.

    For each function definition in the input abstract syntax tree, we build a
    function constification record of type [!type:Constification.f] featuring a
    separate argument constification record of type [!type:Constification.a] for
    each argument in the function prototype. We use these records throughout the
    constification process to determine to which arguments and functions, in the
    case of class member methods, we can add the [const] qualifier at the end.
    Note that we store the function constification records in a hash table of
    type [!type:Constification.r].

    {2:principle Working principle}

    At the beginning of the constification, we assume every argument in every
    function constifiable (see [!Apac_records.build_records]). We then perform
    an analysis of dependencies between function arguments and write operations
    involving the latter within the bodies of corresponding functions (see
    [!analyze]). When the analysis concludes an argument is written to, it
    modifies its constification record so as to mark the argument as
    unconsitifiable, i.e. passes the [const] element of the corresponding record
    of type [!type:Constification.a] to [false]. The same happens for class
    member methods modifying sibling class member variables (see the [const]
    element of function constification records of type
    [!type:Constification.f]). However, we do not modify the constification
    records during the analysis. Instead, we use a stack of type
    [!type:Constification.u] keeping trace of arguments and functions to
    unconstify at the end of the data dependency analysis on arguments and class
    memebers. When we pass an object as argument to a function, we must not
    constify it if it calls a non-[const] class member method. However, we do
    not have this information before processing the elements in the
    [!type:Constification.u] stack (see [!unconstify]). This is why we need a
    second phase to process the elements of a [!type:Constification.o] stack
    (see [!Constification.unconstify]).

    {3:aliases Aliasing}

    Pointers and references within a function definition might alias the same
    data as the arguments of the function. Therefore, when we constify an
    argument, we must constify its aliase(s) too. To keep track of argument
    aliases, we use a hash table of type [!type:Constification.l] (see
    [!Constification.find_unconstifiable]).

    {3:multi Multiple variable declarations}

    When we constify an argument, we must propagate the constification to the
    aliases of the argument as well (see type [!type:Constification.l] and
    [!Constification.constify_arguments]). This process is straightforward in
    the case of simple variable declarations. However, if an argument alias
    appears in a multiple variable declaration, we have two different situations
    to consider:

    1. the data type of the multiple variable declaration is already constant,
   
    {[ // i is a constant integer
       // j is a mutable pointer to a constant integer
       int const i, * j; ]}

    2. the data type of the multiple variable declaration is not constant.

    {[ // i is a mutable integer
       // j is a mutable pointer to a mutable integer
       int i, * j; ]}

    If we want to constify [j] in the first situation, it is possible without
    breaking the multiple variable declaration:

    {[int const i, * const j;}]

    In the second case, we cannot fully constify [j], i.e. [int const * const
    j], without constifying [i], which is not desirable. In this case, we have
    to split the multiple variable declaration into a sequence of simple
    variable declarations and then constify the declaration of [j] only.
    However, we cannot apply this transformation directly applied within
    [!Constification.constify_aliases]. Indeed, the introduction of a new
    sequence of instructions changes the scope of the declared variables. We
    cannot prevent this in a term to term transformation function such as
    [!Constification.constify_aliases], but in a transformation function
    modyfing the abstract syntax tree by side-effect, i.e. a target to unit
    transformation, in which we can call [!Nobrace_transfo.remove_after] to
    effectively remove the braces from the sequence of simple variable
    declarations so as to preserve their initial scope. Therefore,
    [!Constification.constify_aliases] should only mark those multiple variable
    declarations which need to be split into simple variable declarations and
    determine those to constify. To keep track of this information, so we can
    actually perform the transformations (using
    [!Constification.nfold_let_mult]), we use a hash table of type
    [!type:Constification.m]. *)

          In [g], [v] is a reference and the function modifies the target value.
          Therefore, we must not constify the argument [v]. However, [f] calls
          [g] and passes its argument [b] by reference to [g]. This way, [g]
          shall modify the value behind [b]. We already know we must not

          decision also to [b] in [f]. To achieve this and keep track of the

                      [d] is declared as an alias to [a] on L2. The function
                      does not modify The data pointed to by [a]. On L3, [d]
                      becomes an alias for [c]. Then, on L4, the function
                      modifies the data pointed to by [c] through its alias [d].
                      Therefore, the analysis concludes that nor [c] nor [d]
                      should be constified. However, for [a] it concludes that
                      we can constify the argument as the function never
                      modifies the data it is pointing to. In the end, this
                      produces a compilation error as the function assignes [a],
                      which became [const], to the non-[const] variable [d] on
                      L2.
                      
                      In order to avoid this situation, we must propagate the
                      unconstification to previously aliased arguments too. As
                      [aliases] stores all the values that were ever assigned to

      becomes:

  (** [constify ?frs ?trans tg]: expects target [tg] to point at all the

      function's arguments and the function itself whenever it is possible and
      useful. If a hash table of function records is present in the argument
      [frs], update the records in the latter with the results of the
      constification pass. If the [trans] option, by default set to [true], is
      set to [false], the pass updates [frs] but preserves the input source code
      and does not insert any [const] qualifier in it. If [frs] is not present,
      the results of the constification pass are lost.

      For example, let us consider the short C program below defining a function
      [add].

      {[
      void add(int * a, int * b, int c) {
        a[0] = a[0] + b[0] + c;
      }
      ]}

      The arguments [a] and [b] of [add] are pointers to non-[const] data. The
      function overwrites the content at the memory location in [a], but it does
      not modify the contents behind [b] and [c] is not a pointer. Therefore,
      the transformation concludes that it is safe to constify [b]:

      {[
      void add(int * a, const int * b, int c) {
        a[0] = a[0] + b[0] + c;
      }
      ]}

      Let us now analyze a more complex situation:

      {[
      int * g(int * out, int * in, int n) {
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
          out[i] *= in[i];
        return out;
      }
      int * f(int * data, int * result) {
        result = g(result, data);
        return result;
      }
      ]}

      The above short C program defines two functions [g] and [f]. [g] has three
      formal arguments [out], [in] and [n]. [out] and [in] are pointers to
      non-[const] data and [n] is an integer. The function multiplies the
      elements of [out] with the elements of [in] while storing the result in
      [out]. [f] has two formal arguments [data] and [result] pointing to
      non-[const] data. It calls [g] while passing it [result] and [data] as
      arguments. At first, in the case of [g], the constification pass concludes
      that the argument [in] can be safely constified, but not [out], which is
      overwritten by the function. However, [f] calls [g] and passes [result]
      and [data] as actual arguments to [g]. We already know that the the
      corresponding formal arguments [out] and [in] of [g] are pointers to
      non-[const] and [const] data, respectively. Therefore, in the case of [f],
      the pass concludes that [data] can be safely constified, but not [result],
      pointing to data modified in [g]:

      {[
      int * g(int * out, const int * in, int n) {
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
          out[i] *= in[i];
        return out;
      }
      int * f(const int * data, int * result) {
        result = g(result, data);
        return result;

(** {1:return_unification Return unification}

    Handling [return] statements when building a task candidate graph requires a
    preliminary transformation, referred to as return unification, of the
    corresponding function definition. Indeed, in order to guarantee a correct
    return value, a function should wait for the completion of all the tasks it
    has generated before returning. Therefore, we cannot simply include [return]
    statements in task candidates. This pass ensures a single [return] statement
    at the end of each function definition by translating all the other
    [return]s into [goto]s jumping to a placeholder label (see
    [!Apac_macros.goto_label]) preceding that final [return]. This
    transformation then allows us, in the parallel code generation stage, to
    introduce synchronization barriers in such a way as to wait for all the
    tasks of the function to complete prior to returning. If the return type of
    the function is other than [void], the pass introduces a unique variable
    (see [!Apac_macros.result_variable]) to contain the value to return, updates
    it before each [goto] statement and returns it in the final [return]
    statement. *)

(** [unify_returns tg]: expects the target [tg] to point at a function
    definition. It replaces [return] statements within the body of the latter by
    a single [return] statement through the usage of [goto] jumps.

    First of all, the transformation wraps the body of the target function into
    a sequence and marks it with [!Apac_macros.candidate_body_mark], as well as
    [!Apac_macros.candidate_body_mark] in the case of the [main] function. Then,
    if the function returns [void], it appends the [!Apac_macros.goto_label] to
    the sequence and replaces each [return] statement inside the sequence with a
    [goto] jumping to that label.

    For example, the following function definition

    {[
    void returns_nothing(int a, int b) {
      if(a > b) {
        // ... some work with a ...
        return;
      }
      // ... some work with b ...
    }
    ]}

    becomes

    {[
    void returns_nothing(int a, int b) {
      {
        if(a > b) {
          // ... some work with a ...
          goto __apac_exit;
        }
        // ... some work with b ...
    __apac_exit: ;
      }
    }
    ]}

    If the function returns a value, the transformation preprends the sequence
    with the declaration of [!Apac_macros.result_variable], appends the
    [!Apac_macros.goto_label] to the sequence and replaces each [return]
    statement inside the sequence with an assignment of the value to return to
    the [!Apac_macros.result_variable] and a [goto] jumping to
    [!Apac_macros.goto_label].

    For example, the following function definition

    {[
    void returns_something(int a, int b) {
      if(a > b) {
        // ... some work with a ...
        return a;
      }
      // ... some work with b ...
      return b;
    }
    ]}

    becomes

    {[
    void returns_something(int a, int b) {
      {
        if(a > b) {
          // ... some work with a ...
          __apac_ret = a;
          goto __apac_exit;
        }
        // ... some work with b ...
        __apac_ret = b;
        goto __apac_exit;
    __apac_exit: ;
      }
    }
