(*****************************)

(* [lvar]: labelled variable type. We make use of this type to make a difference
   between class member variables. Indeed, in the case of a class member, the
   associated variable is represented always by [this]. As a result every member
   of a given class ends up with [this] as name and the same identifier (which
   changes only from one class method to another).

   For example, let us consider:

   class C {
     int a; int b;
     int f() { int c = a / b; return c; }
     int g() { return a * b; }
   }

   In [f], both [a] and [b] will have [this] as name as well as the same
   identifier, 75 for example. In [g], the identifier will change, let us say to
   42, but then both [a] and [b] in [g] will have [this] as name and 42 as
   identifier. The only way to make a difference between two class memebers
   within a member method is to look at the labels (strings) associated with
   each occurence. To take into account this situation within the constification
   process, we use a variable type extended with a label.

(* [const_arg]: an argument constification record. *)
type const_arg = {
    (* Tells whether the argument is a reference or a pointer. *)
    is_ptr_or_ref : bool;
    (* Tells whether the argument can be constified. *)
    mutable is_const : bool;
    (* If the argument is a reference or a pointer, i.e. when [is_ptr_or_ref] is
       true, and if the value in memory it refers or points to is modified
       within the body of the associated function, the argument must not be
       constified.
       
       To explain [to_unconst_by_propagation] let us consider a function [g]
       defined as follows:
       
         void g(int &val) { val += 4; }
       
       and a function [f] defined as follows:
       
         int f(int a, int b) { g(b); return a + b; }
       
       In [g], [val] is a reference and the referenced value is modified within
       the function's body. Therefore, the argument [val] must not be
       constified. However, [f] calls [g] and passes one of its arguments, i.e.
       [b], by reference to [g]. This way, the value referenced by [b] will be
       modified within [g]. We already know that [val] in [g] must not be
       constified. Because of this dependency, we must propagate this decision
       also to [b] in [f]. To achieve this and keep track of the dependency, we
       will add:
       
         (f, b)
       
       to the [to_unconst_by_propagation] associative (function variable [var]
       -> argument variable [lvar]) list in the [const_arg] record in [g]. *)
    mutable to_unconst_by_propagation : (var * var) list;
  }

(* [const_fun]: a function constification record. *)
type const_fun = {
    (* Associative (argument variable -> constification record) list of
       constification records for all the argument of the function. *)
    const_args : (var * const_arg) list;
    (* Tells whether the function can be constified. Note that this information
       is relevant only if the function is a class member method. *)
    mutable is_const : bool;
    (* Tells whether the return value is a pointer. *)
    is_ret_ptr : bool;
    (* Tells whether the return value is a reference. *)
    is_ret_ref : bool;
    (* Tells whether the function is a class member method. *)
    mutable is_class_method : bool;
    (* Augmented AST of the function's body storing data dependencies of its
       instructions. See [atrm] below. *)
    mutable aast : atrm option;
  }

(* [const_funs]: type for a hash table of [const_fun]. The keys are functions
   represented by terms of type [var]. *)
and const_funs = const_fun Var_Hashtbl.t

(* [const_aliases]: type for hash table of argument aliases.

   Pointers and references used within a function definition might be linked to
   the same data as the arguments of the function, i.e. they represent aliases
   to the function's arguments. Therefore, when we constify an argument, we must
   constify its aliase(s) too. To keep trace of argument aliases, we use a hash
   table data type where the key is the [lvar] of the alias and the value is a
   pair of a [lvar] and an [int]. The [lvar] element corresponds to the function
   argument being aliased. The [int] element gives the pointer degree of the
   alias, if the latter is a pointer, e.g. the pointer degree of [int ** tab] is
   2. *)
and const_aliases = (lvar * int) LVar_Hashtbl.t

(* [const_unconst]: type of stack of function arguments, except for objects,
   that must not be constified.

   At the beginning of the constification process, we assume that every function
   argument in every function can be constified, see
   [build_constification_records]. Then, we perform an analysis of dependencies
   between function arguments and write operations involving the latter within
   the body of corresponding functions, see [identify_mutables]. When the
   analysis concludes that a function argument is written to, it shall modify
   the associated constification record so as to mark the argument as
   non-consitifiable. The same goes also for class methods modifying sibling
   class members. Such methods should not be consitified either. See [const_arg]
   and [const_fun] for more details. 

   However, the constification records are not modified directly during the
   analysis. Instead, we use a stack keeping trace of functions arguments and
   functions that shall be unconstified once the analysis terminates, see
   [to_unconst] below. The elements of the stack are pairs of the [var]
   identifying the target function and the [var] identifying its argument to
   unconstify. If the latter represents the [lvar] of the function, i.e. when
   both of the elements of the pair are equal [lvars], it means that the
   function itself should be unconstified. See
   [unconstify_mutables.unconstify_to_unconst_objects]. *)
and const_unconst = (var * var) Stack.t

(* [const_unconst_objects]: type of stack of function arguments, represented by
   objects, that must not be constified. 

   When an object is passed as argument to a function, it must not be constified
   if it is used to call a non-const class method which may modify one or more
   members of the class. However, this information is not know before the
   elements in a [const_unconst] stack are processed (see
   [unconstify_mutables]). This is why a second phase is necessary to process
   the elements of a [const_unconst_objects] stack (see [unconstify_mutables]).
   Here, an element is represented by a triplet of [var]s where the first [var]
   identifies the target function, the second [var] identifies the argument of
   that function to unconstify and the third [var] represents the class member
   method called on that argument. Then, during the unconstification process
   (see [unconstify_mutables]), if the method represented by the third [var]
   gets unconstified, the argument (second [var]) of the function targeted by
   the first [var] will be unconstified too. *)
and const_unconst_objects = (var * var * var) Stack.t

(* [const_mult]: type of hash table for multiple variable declarations that must
   be transformed into sequences of simple variable declarations while
   constifying one or more of the variables being declared.

   When a function argument is constified, it is necessary to propagate the
   constification to the aliases of the argument as well. This is done with the
   [Apac_basic.constify_arguments] function. This process is straightforward in
   the case of simple variable declarations. However, if an argument alias is
   declared within a multiple variable declaration, we have two different
   situations to consider: 

   1) the inner type of the multiple variable declaration is already constant:
    
      // [i] is a constant integer, [j] is a mutable pointer to a constant
      // integer
      int const i, * j;

   2) the inner type of the multiple variable declaration is not constant:

      // [i] is a mutable integer, [j] is a mutable pointer to a mutable integer
      int i, * j;

   If we want to constify [j] in 1), it is possible without breaking the parent
   multiple variable declaration:

   int const i, * const j;

   In 2) we cannot fully constify [j], i.e. [int const * const j], without
   constifying [i], which is not always desirable. In this case, we have to
   split the parent multiple variable declaration into a sequence of simple
   variable declarations and then constify the declaration of [j] only. However,
   this transformation cannot be directly applied within
   [Apac_basic.constify_aliases_on]. Indeed, the introduction of a new sequence
   of instructions changes the scope of the declared variables. This can be
   prevented, but not in a term to term transformation function such as
   [Apac_basic.constify_aliases_on]. It must be done in a transformation
   function modyfing the AST by side-effect, i.e. a target to unit
   transformation, in which we can call [Nobrace_transfo.remove_after] to
   effectively remove the braces from the sequence of simple variable
   declarations so as to preserve their initial scope. Therefore,
   [Apac_basic.constify_aliases_on] should only mark those multiple variable
   declarations which need to be split into simple variable declarations and
   determine which declarations should be constified. To keep track of this
   information, so we can actually perform the transformations (using
   [Apac_basic.unfold_let_mult]), we use a hash table where the keys are the
   marks (strings) added to the concerned multiple variable declarations and
   where the values are lists of booleans. The latter have as many elements as
   there are declarations in the target multiple variable declaration. In other
   terms, a boolean value is associated to each variable declaration. If the
   value is [true], it means that the corresponding variable declaration should
   be constified. *)
and const_mult = (mark, bool list) Hashtbl.t

(* I.2 Taskification *)
(*********************)

(* [atrm]: augmented term type. The initial task DAG of a function considers
   each instruction and each block of instructions (loops, scopes, switches,
   ...) as a separate task. Prior to building the initial task DAG of a
   function, we have to compute the potential data dependencies between the
   future tasks. During this process, we iterate over the local AST of the
   target function and build an augmented local AST holding the dependency
   information. This augmented local AST is built out of [atrm] elements. Each
   [atrm] can represent a task by itself. An [atrm] element is composed of: *)
