(** [unify_returns tg]: expects the target [tg] to point at a function
    definition. It replaces [return] statements within the body of the latter by
    a single [return] statement through the usage of [goto] jumps.

    First of all, the transformation wraps the body of the target function into
    a sequence and marks it with [!Apac_macros.candidate_body_mark], as well as
    [!Apac_macros.candidate_body_mark] in the case of the [main] function. Then,
    if the function returns [void], it appends the [!Apac_macros.goto_label] to
    the sequence and replaces each [return] statement inside the sequence with a
    [goto] jumping to that label.

    For example, the following function definition

    {[
    void returns_nothing(int a, int b) {
      if(a > b) {
        // ... some work with a ...
        return;
      }
      // ... some work with b ...
    }
    ]}

    becomes

    {[
    void returns_nothing(int a, int b) {
      {
        if(a > b) {
          // ... some work with a ...
          goto __apac_exit;
        }
        // ... some work with b ...
    __apac_exit: ;
      }
    }
    ]}

    If the function returns a value, the transformation preprends the sequence
    with the declaration of [!Apac_macros.result_variable], appends the
    [!Apac_macros.goto_label] to the sequence and replaces each [return]
    statement inside the sequence with an assignment of the value to return to
    the [!Apac_macros.result_variable] and a [goto] jumping to
    [!Apac_macros.goto_label].

    For example, the following function definition

    {[
    void returns_something(int a, int b) {
      if(a > b) {
        // ... some work with a ...
        return a;
      }
      // ... some work with b ...
      return b;
    }
    ]}

    becomes

    {[
    void returns_something(int a, int b) {
      {
        if(a > b) {
          // ... some work with a ...
          __apac_ret = a;
          goto __apac_exit;
        }
        // ... some work with b ...
        __apac_ret = b;
        goto __apac_exit;
    __apac_exit: ;
      }
