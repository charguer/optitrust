(** [trm_look_for_dependencies t]: searches the term [t] for data accesses. It
    returns two lists. The first list holds the access terms where each term is
    paired with an access attribute. The second list contains all the variables
    involved in the data accesses. *)

      (t : trm) : (Dep_set.t * Dep_set.t * ioattrs_map * TaskAttr_set.t)  =
  (** [trm_look_for_dependencies.aux ins inouts attrs filter nested fc attr t]:
      builds [ins], a stack of input (read-only) data dependencies in [t],
      [inouts], a stack of input-output (read-write) data dependencies in [t],
      [attrs], a set stack of dependency-dependency attribute pairs indicating
      which of the dependencies have the [Subscripted] or the [Accessor]
      attribute.

      Note that we build stacks by side-effect instead of returning a list.
      This is due to the usage of [trm_iter] for visiting [t]. [trm_iter] allows
      us to call [aux] on each term it visits but the latter has to have a
      [unit] return type.

      When [nested] is [true], the function does not push a new item to stack,
      it simply continues to explore the AST. This happens, for example, in the
      case of a nested get operation such as [***ptr].

      When [fc] is [true], it means that [t] is part of a function call.

      Finally, [attr] allows for passing access attributes between recursive
      calls to [aux], e.g. in the case of nested data accesses (see the
      [access_attr] type for more details). *)

(** [merge tg]: expects the target [tg] to point at a function body. It then
    tries to optimize its task candidate graph representation by merging
    inter-dependent task candidates that could not yield parallelizable tasks.
    The idea is to identify and squash sequences of inter-dependent task
    candidates beginning with a task candidate having a single successor,
    containing task candidates with a single predecessor and a single successor,
    to end with a task candidate having a single predecessor.

    Let us take the example of the following task candidate graph with 5
    vertices ([{v1}] to [{v5}]):

    {[+-----------------------+     +-----------------------------+
      |         {v3}          |     |            {v1}             |
      |    c = add(c, b);     |     | int a = 10, b = 11, c = 10; |
      | (in: [b], inout: [c]) | <-- | (in: [], inout: [a, b, c])  |
      +-----------------------+     +-----------------------------+
        |                             |
        |                             |
        v                             v
      +-----------------------+     +-----------------------------+
      |         {v5}          |     |            {v2}             |  
      |    c = mul(c, b);     |     |       a = add(a, b);        |
      | (in: [b], inout: [c]) |     |    (in: [b], inout: [a])    |
      +-----------------------+     +-----------------------------+
                                      |
                                      |
                                      v
                                    +-----------------------------+
                                    |            {v4}             |  
                                    |       a = mul(a, b);        |
                                    |    (in: [b], inout: [a])    |
                                    +-----------------------------+]}

    There are two sequences of mergeable vertices in the above graph, i.e. the
    sequence containing [{v2}] and [{v4}] as well as the sequence containing
    [{v3}] and [{v5}]. The application of the [merge] transformation on the
    above task candidate graph would result in this task candidate graph with 3
    vertices:

    {[+-----------------------+     +-----------------------------+
      |         {v3}          |     |            {v1}             |
      |    c = add(c, b);     |     | int a = 10, b = 11, c = 10; |
      |    c = mul(c, b);     |     | (in: [], inout: [a, b, c])  |
      | (in: [b], inout: [c]) | <-- |                             |
      +-----------------------+     +-----------------------------+
                                      |
                                      |
                                      v
                                    +-----------------------------+
                                    |            {v2}             |
                                    |       a = add(a, b);        |
                                    |       a = mul(a, b);        |
                                    |    (in: [b], inout: [a])    |
                                    +-----------------------------+]}
