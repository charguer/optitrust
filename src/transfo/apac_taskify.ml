(* [task_group ?mark_group ~master t]: puts the instruction sequence of a
   function's body into an OpenMP task group, i.e. a block of instructions
   delimited by curly brackets and prepended with the OpenMP pragma '#pragma omp
   taskgroup'.

    Example:

          int g() {
            int a;
            f();
            return 0;

            f()
          }
            return 0;
          }

    If [master] is true, the transformation creates a task group that will be
    executed only by one thread, the master thread, using the following pragmas:

      #pragma omp parallel
      #pragma omp master
      #pragma omp taskgroup

    Example:

      int main() {
        int a;
        f();
        return 0;
      }

      becomes

      #pragma omp parallel
      #pragma omp master
      #pragma omp taskgroup
      {
        int a;
        f()
      }
        return 0;
      }

    [mark_group] - decides whether the [Apac_core.task_group_mark] shall be
                   added to the resulting task group sequence;
    [master] - decides whether extra pragmas should be added for limiting the
               execution of the task group to only thread, the master thread;
    [t] - AST of a function body.

(* [parallel_task_group ?mark_group tg]: expects target [tg] to point at a
   function definition.

    The first step of the transformation consists in replacing return statements
    by gotos. At the beginning of the process, the function's body is wrapped
    into a sequence to which a mark is assigned.  See
    [Apac_basic.use_goto_for_return] for more details.

    In the second step, we put the marked sequence into an OpenMP task group.
    See [Apac_basic.task_group] for more details.

    If [mark_group] is [true], [Apac_basic.task_group] will add the
    [Apac_core.task_group_mark] to the task group sequence. This way, we can
    target the task group sequences later when inserting tasks into the
    code. Note that the aforementioned mark is not the same thing. That mark is
    unique and serves to identify the target function's body. It only lives
    within this transformation function. We have to use this extra unique mark
    here, otherwise the fourth step could target more than one AST term, which
    is not desirable. *)

     due to the usage of [trm_iter] for visiting [t]. [trm_iter] allows us to
     call [aux] on each term it visits but the latter has to have a [unit]
     return type. When [nested] is [true], the function does not push a new item
     to the stack, it simply continues to explore the AST. This happens, for
     example, in the case of a nested get operation such as [***ptr]. Finally,
     [attr] allows for passing access attributes between recursive calls to
